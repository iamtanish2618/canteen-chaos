# Canteen Chaos

The hostel canteen's ordering site. Students browse the menu, add
dishes to a cart, apply coupons, pick a collection time and place an
order. Staff watch the queue on a counter dashboard and move orders
along.

It works — mostly. Some things in it are broken, and your job is to
find and fix the ones you are given.



## Running it

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The server serves the frontend too, so that
is the only command you need.

The canteen has opening hours (7:00 AM – 10:00 PM) and meal slots, so
outside those hours most dishes show as "not served now". If you are
working late:

```bash
TZ=Pacific/Auckland npm start
```

Other settings, all optional:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
||||
| `LATENCY_MS` | 250 | Delay added to every API call. Set `0` for instant responses. |
| `AUTO_COOK` | true | Orders move along by themselves. |
| `ORDER_RATE_MAX` | 40 | Orders per minute before you get rate limited. |



## What is in the repo

```
backend/
  server.js        wiring
  store.js         reads and writes the JSON files
  routes/          one file per resource
  logic/           where the actual thinking happens
  data/            menu, coupons, orders, ratings, members
frontend/
  index.html       three views in one page
  style.css
  js/              one module per concern
```

Two things worth knowing before you start:

- **`logic/` holds plain functions.** Pricing, validation, availability,
  the order state machine and so on. Most behaviour you can see in the
  browser is decided in there.
- **The server owns the truth.** Opening hours, stock, prices and
  discounts are all decided server-side. The browser only displays what
  it is told.

Reset the data if a test run leaves it in a strange state:

```bash
git checkout -- backend/data/
```



## Your task

You will be given a **bug log** — a list of specific problems reported
in this app. Each one describes what a person saw, not where the
problem is. Finding that is the task.

For every bug you are assigned:

1. **Reproduce it.** Make it happen on your own machine before you
   change anything.
2. **Find the cause.** The symptom and the cause are usually in
   different files.
3. **Fix it properly.** Patch the cause, not the symptom. Hiding a
   button is not the same as fixing a rule.
4. **Write it down** in `LOG.md`, in your own words:
   - what you did to reproduce it
   - what was actually wrong
   - what you changed, and why that is the right place to change it

The log matters as much as the fix. A correct patch you cannot explain
counts for nothing.



## Brownie points

Not required, and not needed to clear the task — but they count.

- **Bugs nobody reported.** There are problems in this app that are not
  in your bug log. Find one, prove it, and write it up the same way.
  Say how you noticed it.
- **A test.** A script or a check that fails before your fix and passes
  after.
- **An honest note.** Something you noticed but could not fix, or a fix
  you are unsure about, explained clearly. This scores better than
  silence.

One rule: a brownie-point fix must not break anything else. If it does,
it costs you rather than earns you.



## Rules

- **No AI tools.** No ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor or anything
  similar. We are testing how you debug, not how you prompt.
- **Documentation, Stack Overflow and asking seniors are all fine.**
  Anything where you still have to work out what applies to your code.
- **Commit as you go.** Small commits with real messages. One giant
  commit at the end will be asked about.
- **You will explain your work live.** Everyone shortlisted sits a
  short session: you talk through your fixes and make one small change
  while we watch. Work you cannot explain does not count, however
  correct it looks.

Stuck for more than an hour on one thing? Ask in the group. Asking is
not a penalty — it is what you would do on a real team.

## Debugging submission

All ten reported issues are addressed; see [LOG.md](LOG.md) for measured before/after observations, two extra defects, and limitations. AI assistance was used with the candidate's stated permission from the society.

Run regression checks with `cd backend && npm ci && npm test`. Tests isolate their fixtures from the application's JSON files. This remains a local debugging exercise; the inherited staff endpoints are unauthenticated and should not be exposed as a production service.
